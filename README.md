# Diabetic-retinopathy-classification


A deep learning system for automatic classification of diabetic retinopathy stages from retinal fundus images using Google's Vision Transformer (ViT-Base) architecture.

Overview
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a diabetes complication that affects the eyes and can lead to vision loss if left undetected. Early detection through retinal screening is crucial for timely treatment. This project implements an AI-based solution that can automatically classify the severity of diabetic retinopathy from retinal fundus images into different clinical stages.

The system utilizes Google's Vision Transformer (ViT-Base) pretrained model, fine-tuned on a balanced dataset of 50,000 retinal images to achieve high accuracy in classification.

Features
Multi-class classification of diabetic retinopathy into clinical stages:
No DR (0)
Mild NPDR (1)
Moderate NPDR (2)
Severe NPDR (3)
Proliferative DR (4)
Interactive web interface built with Streamlit
High-performance model based on transformer architecture
Balanced dataset training to prevent class bias
Installation
bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetic-retinopathy-classification.git
cd diabetic-retinopathy-classification

# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Requirements
The project requires the following main dependencies:

torch>=1.9.0
torchvision>=0.10.0
streamlit>=1.0.0
pillow>=8.2.0
numpy>=1.20.0
timm>=0.4.12
pandas>=1.3.0
scikit-learn>=0.24.2
matplotlib>=3.4.0
See requirements.txt for the complete list.

Usage
Running the Web Interface
bash
streamlit run app.py
This will start the Streamlit server and open a browser window with the web interface. You can upload retinal fundus images, and the system will predict the stage of diabetic retinopathy.

Using the Model Programmatically
python
from model import DRClassifier

# Initialize the model
model = DRClassifier(pretrained=True)

# Make predictions
import PIL.Image
image = PIL.Image.open('path/to/fundus_image.jpg')
prediction = model.predict(image)

# Output will be a class (0-4) and confidence scores
print(f"DR Stage: {prediction['class']}")
print(f"Confidence: {prediction['confidence']:.2f}")
Model Architecture
The system uses a modified Vision Transformer (ViT-Base) architecture:

Base model: Google's ViT-Base (12 transformer layers)
Input size: 224×224 RGB images
Patch size: 16×16
Hidden dimension: 768
MLP size: 3072
Attention heads: 12
Parameters: ~86M
Classification head: Custom 5-class output layer
Dataset
The model was trained on a carefully balanced dataset of 50,000 retinal fundus images:

10,000 images per class (5 classes)
Images sourced from multiple public datasets (Kaggle EyePACS, APTOS, Messidor, etc.)
Preprocessed for quality enhancement and standardization
Augmented with techniques like rotation, flipping, brightness/contrast adjustments
Performance
On our test set, the model achieves:

Overall Accuracy: 92.4%
Mean F1-Score: 0.918
Per-class Sensitivity: >89% for all classes
Per-class Specificity: >94% for all classes
Training
The model was trained using:

PyTorch framework
Mixed precision training
Learning rate: 2e-5 with cosine annealing scheduler
Batch size: 64
Epochs: 30 with early stopping
Training time: ~18 hours on 4×NVIDIA V100 GPUs
To retrain the model:

bash
python train.py --data_dir /path/to/dataset --epochs 30 --batch_size 64
Evaluation and Testing
To evaluate the model on your test set:

bash
